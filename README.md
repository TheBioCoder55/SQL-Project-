# SQL_Project
Practiced and executed SQL queries on two real-world-style sample databases — Northwind (a classic sales and inventory dataset) and Airline DB — to explore key business metrics and sales insights.

**Key Highlights:**

- Wrote complex queries using JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, CTE, and CASE
- Analyzed customer orders, product performance, and regional sales trends
- Calculated key metrics like total sales, average order value, most ordered products, and top revenue-generating regions
- Used LEFT JOIN, INNER JOIN, and subqueries to extract cross-table insights
- Applied window functions (e.g., RANK, ROW_NUMBER) for ranking and trend analysis

These projects improved my SQL querying skills and gave me hands-on experience with sales data, preparing me for real-world business intelligence and data analysis tasks.
