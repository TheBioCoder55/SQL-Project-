# 🧾 SQL Project: Sales & Business Data Analysis (Northwind + Airline DB)

## 📝 Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to write and execute **SQL queries** on two real-world-style relational databases — **Northwind** (a classic retail dataset) and **Airline DB** (flight booking and operations data). The focus was to explore business metrics, customer behavior, and regional performance using advanced SQL techniques.

## 🧠 Key Highlights
- 🔗 Wrote complex queries using:
  - `JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `INNER JOIN`
  - `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`
  - `CTE`, `CASE`, and subqueries

- 📊 Analyzed:
  - Customer order patterns
  - Product sales performance
  - Regional and category-wise revenue trends

- 📈 Calculated key business metrics:
  - Total Sales  
  - Average Order Value  
  - Most Ordered Products  
  - Top Revenue-Generating Regions

- 🧮 Applied **Window Functions**:
  - `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `DENSE_RANK()` for trend analysis and ranking
